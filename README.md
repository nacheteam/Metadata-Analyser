# Metadata-Analyser
This is a simple metadata analyser that let you know the information in a file and modify it if required.  
By now it works with pdf files for reading and removing metadata and with images for reading their metadata and plot if available the geolocation.  
It is executed with no arguments.  
The files that you want to analyse should be in the data folder and the results will be placed in the result folder. When the program asks you the file you should only put the name of the file. For example if we want to analyse the pdf sample we should put PDF as type of file and Probabilidad.pdf as file name.  
Installation:  
pip3 install PyPDF2  
pip3 install Pillow  
pip3 install gmplot
